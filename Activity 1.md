So at 6:10 I heard my mom shouting for me to wake up. I slowly open my eye and get down my bunk bed
im so sleepy but I know I have to come to school so I grab my cloth and go take a shower.
after taking a shower,brush my teeth and check my phone I go down stair to go eat breakfast I eat crumble egg it was so good I also drink milk
my cousin came to my house to go to school with us.After im done eating I walk to another room to go feed my cat her name is wanmai
at about 7:20 I get in the car while driving I talk to my cousin and I sleep all the way to school
when I arrive its about 8:20 I walk up by the escalator and go to floor 11 with my sister 
there is still plenty of time left so we went 7-11 I didn't buy anything because I accidentally forgot my wallet up stair
when its 8:55 I walk up to floor 11 to learn science
